# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

When generating text for Flint, adhere to this brand persona.

## Brand Persona
Flint is the "Autonomous Website Platform". We position ourselves as the futuristic, high-performance solution that handles the heavy lifting so engineering teams don't have to.

## Brand Personality Keywords
* **Autonomous**: Emphasize automation and "hands-free" capabilities.
* **High-Performance**: Use words like "scale", "performing", "speed".
* **Minimalist**: Keep copy short, punchy, and to the point.
* **Confident**: Use definitive statements ("Any page you want", "Customers love Flint").

## Grammar & Mechanics rules
* **Headings**: Use **Serif fonts** for headings. Use Sentence Case for most subheadings, but Title Case for major Hero headers is acceptable if it fits the design.
* **Punctuation**: Use periods for headlines (e.g., "Published and performing."). This is a distinct style choice.
* **Structure**: Short paragraphs. Bullet points are okay but prefer grid layouts with short descriptions.
